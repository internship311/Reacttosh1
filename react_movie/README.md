# TMDB API Key Info

This is a movie project made by using ReactJS, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. There are usage of Styled Components, React Hooks, Custom Hooks and React Router (v6). 

This project fetches data from TMDB API. The URL for the TMDB API is : https://www.themoviedb.org/. For safety and security reasons I have not shared the API key in the Github repo of this project.

In case if anyone wants to create his/her API key for this running this project. Please follow the below the steps:

1. Go to the TMDB website. The URL of this website is https://www.themoviedb.org/.
2. To create a new account on TMDB, click on Join TMDB and create your username and password and submit them.
3. After account creation, login with the username and password you created.
4. Click on your profile icon, then click on Settings -> API.
5. After clicking on API, click on "click here" link under the heading "Request an API Key".
6. Click on Developer option. After this, it will ask for some details. Fill those details and submit them. You will get your API key after that.
7. Create an .env file in the project. Type "REACT_APP_API_KEY =" and after '=' sign input your API key.
8. Run the Application using npm start.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
